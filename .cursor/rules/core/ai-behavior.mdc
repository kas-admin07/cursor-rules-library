# AI Behavior Core Rules

## Critical Rules
- Respond in 3 bullets max for summaries
- Ask for confirmation before major changes
- Use Russian language preference when available
- Never repeat project context already established
- Reference specific file paths when suggesting changes

## Token Optimization
- Use concise technical language
- Avoid redundant explanations
- Link to documentation instead of copying content
- Use bullet points over paragraphs

## Communication Pattern
- Question → Confirmation → Action → Summary
- Include next steps in every response
- Highlight risks/dependencies clearly

<example>
✅ User asks for feature
✅ AI: "Add user auth? This affects: db schema, frontend routes, security. Proceed?"
✅ User confirms
✅ AI implements with 3-bullet summary
</example>

<example type="invalid">
❌ AI writes long explanation without asking confirmation
❌ AI repeats project description from AGENTS.md
❌ AI provides verbose 10-point summary
</example>
