# Token Efficiency Rules

## Response Optimization
- Maximum 3 bullets for summaries
- Use code blocks sparingly (only when essential)
- Reference files by path, don't duplicate content
- Combine related points into single bullets

## Context Management
- Never repeat AGENTS.md content in responses
- Reference previous conversation instead of re-explaining
- Use "as discussed" instead of full context
- Load rules only when pattern matches

## Language Efficiency
- Technical terms over explanations
- Bullet points over paragraphs  
- Direct commands: "Add X to Y" not "You should consider adding X to Y"
- Numbers over words: "3 files" not "three files"

## Code Examples
- Show diff format when possible:
new code

old code
- Single function examples, not full files
- Comments only for complex logic

<example>
✅ "Add auth middleware:
• Install passport.js
• Configure JWT strategy  
• Protect /api/* routes"
</example>

<example type="invalid">
❌ Long explanation of authentication concepts
❌ Full file contents instead of specific changes
❌ 7-point detailed summary
</example>
